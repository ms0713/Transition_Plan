# Transition_Plan
This is a sample Transition Plan document for step by step transition with planning each step and getting feedback for the same and revise accordingly.
To **plan a transition from a third-party development team to in-house**, you need to approach it like a short-term project with well-defined phases, responsibilities, and outcomes. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you **create and execute a smooth transition plan**.

---

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Transition Plan

### ✅ **1. Define Scope of the Transition**

Clarify what’s being taken over:

* Entire product?
* Only development? What about support, QA, DevOps?
* Are you also inheriting infrastructure or third-party integrations?

---

### ✅ **2. Form a Transition Team**

| Role                                  | Responsibility                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Transition Owner (you or a senior PM) | Owns end-to-end transition plan                |
| Technical Lead(s)                     | Review architecture, lead KT sessions          |
| Developers                            | Shadow, learn, and eventually take over coding |
| QA/Testers                            | Understand testing strategy and test suite     |
| DevOps/Infra                          | Learn deployment and monitoring systems        |
| Support Engineer(s)                   | Learn incident management, known issues        |

---

### ✅ **3. Develop the Transition Timeline**

| Phase                | Duration   | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Planning             | 3–5 days   | Access, team setup, transition charter   |
| KT Sessions          | 2–4 weeks  | Structured knowledge transfer            |
| Shadowing            | 1–2 weeks  | Your team observes third-party work      |
| Reverse Shadowing    | 1 week     | Your team executes, vendor observes      |
| Cutover              | 1 week     | Ownership shift to internal team         |
| Post-Cutover Support | 1–2 months | Vendor support under retainer (optional) |

🛠 **Tip:** Use a Gantt chart or Kanban board to manage visibility and task tracking.

---

### ✅ **4. Create a Knowledge Transfer (KT) Calendar**

Break down the system into functional and technical areas. Schedule sessions like:

| Topic                           | Stakeholders | Format         | Duration  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------- |

| CI/CD Process                   | Dev, DevOps  | Demo           | 1 hour    |
| Deployment Process              | DevOps       | Hands-on       | 1 hour    |
| Production Support Scenarios    | Support, Dev | Scenario-based | 1–2 hours |
| Known Issues and Technical Debt | Dev, QA      | Discussion     | 1 hour    |

🎯 Ensure:

* All sessions are **recorded**
* There are **follow-up Q\&A sessions**
* You maintain a **KT tracker** (topic, date, attendees, action items)

---

### ✅ **5. Track Deliverables from Vendor**

Create a checklist like:

* ✅ Source code access (repos)
* ✅ Build instructions (local + CI/CD)
* ✅ Environment setup (Dev, UAT, Prod)
* ✅ Database schema + ER diagrams
* ✅ Secrets/config values (API keys, etc.)
* ✅ Test cases and automation scripts
* ✅ Documentation (Dev, Infra, Runbooks)
* ✅ List of active bugs/tickets
* ✅ Known technical debt
* ✅ Past release history and changelogs

---

### ✅ **6. Conduct Reviews at Each Milestone**

Hold checkpoints:

* After KT phase: Assess knowledge absorption
* After shadowing: Identify remaining gaps
* Pre-cutover: Dry run production activities
* Post-cutover: Weekly sync for 1–2 months

---

### ✅ **7. Communicate Clearly**

* Inform internal stakeholders about the transition
* Create an escalation matrix
* Notify business or users if there will be short-term support impacts

---

### ✅ **8. Post-Transition Improvements**

* Identify quick wins (e.g., code cleanups, automation)
* Refine dev processes (Agile, CI/CD, testing)
* Plan for team upskilling (e.g., Java/Spring boot bootcamps)

---
Building your in-house team is **critical for long-term success** after transitioning from a third-party vendor. Here's how to approach it strategically, aligned with your goals of improving **code quality**, **delivery timelines**, and **team responsiveness**.

---
Defining the **scope of the transition** is the **first and most important step** — it sets clear boundaries for what your internal team will take over, what remains with the vendor (if anything), and how responsibilities are split during the transition.

Here’s how to approach it thoroughly:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Define Scope of the Transition

---

### 🔍 1. **Clarify What Is Being Taken Over**

Break down the areas you might take over, and decide **yes/no/partial** for each:

| Area                        | Scope          | Notes                                |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Application Development   | Full / Partial | All backend + frontend code          |
| ✅ QA / Testing              | Full / Partial | Manual + automation                  |
| ✅ Support / Bug Triage      | Full / Partial | L1, L2, and L3 support               |
| ✅ DevOps / CI/CD            | Full / Partial | Build, deploy, release management    |
| ✅ Infrastructure            | Full / Partial | Cloud accounts, on-prem infra        |
| ✅ Monitoring & Alerts       | Full / Partial | Logs, alerts, health checks          |
| ✅ Product Roadmap Ownership | Full / Partial | Will you own backlog and priorities? |

---

### 🧩 2. **Understand Current Vendor Responsibilities**

Create a map of what the vendor currently does:

* Code ownership and deployments?
* Infrastructure provisioning and maintenance?
* Customer support or ticketing?
* Business analysis or backlog grooming?

👉 This helps avoid **accidental scope gaps** (e.g., missing knowledge on DB backup processes).

---

### 🛑 3. **Call Out What Will Stay with Vendor (if any)**

Some areas might remain with the vendor temporarily or permanently:

* Specialized modules (e.g., analytics, integration)
* Legacy systems they built
* Emergency hotfixes (for 1–2 months)

📌 Clearly document this in your **transition agreement**.

---

### 📁 4. **Inventory of Assets to Be Handovered**

Prepare a list of deliverables the vendor must provide:

| Asset              | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Source Code        | All modules, latest version            |
| Build Pipelines    | YAML files, deployment scripts         |
| Environment Setup  | .env, secrets, database                |
| Documentation      | Dev, API, infra, SOPs                  |
| Access Credentials | Cloud, repo, tools                     |
| Open Issues        | List of known bugs or technical debt   |
| Past Releases      | History of deployments, rollback steps |

---

### 📦 5. **Clarify Transition Boundaries**

Specify:

* When vendor responsibility **officially ends** (cutover date)
* What constitutes **“completion”** of handover
* Who handles any **gray areas** (e.g., performance bugs found after cutover)

---

### 📜 6. **Document Scope in a Transition Charter**

Create a one-pager with:

* 📌 What’s in scope
* 🚫 What’s out of scope
* 🕓 Timeline for handover
* 👥 Roles and responsibilities

Example snippet:

```
Scope Statement:
The in-house team will take full responsibility for backend development, API integration, and production support. The vendor will retain monitoring configuration ownership for 2 weeks post-cutover and provide emergency bugfix support until August 15.
```

---

Forming the **right transition team** is essential to ensure that knowledge is absorbed correctly, critical responsibilities are assigned, and your in-house team is prepared to fully take ownership. This team becomes the **core group** responsible for executing the transition and carrying forward future enhancements, support, and maintenance.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Form a Transition Team

---

### 🎯 Goals of the Transition Team

* Absorb functional and technical knowledge from the vendor
* Participate actively in KT sessions and audits
* Validate setup, deployments, and processes
* Handle support, coding, testing, and releases post-cutover
* Drive process improvement post-transition

---

| Database | SQL Server / PostgreSQL, ORM (Hibernate, EF)     |
| Testing  | Selenium, Postman, JUnit, NUnit                  |
| CI/CD    | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps            |
| Infra    | Docker, Kubernetes, IIS/Nginx, cloud (Azure/AWS) |

---

### ✅ **4. Establish Clear Responsibilities**

Define responsibilities and ownership early:

* Who owns bug fixes?
* Who owns production support?
* Who will drive documentation?
* Who handles releases?

This reduces confusion post-handover.

---

### ✅ **5. Upskill Your Team Early**

Even before the transition is fully complete:

* Start **shadowing** KT sessions
* Assign people to take **notes and build internal documentation**
* Assign one or two people to **set up and run the code locally**
* Run **internal code reviews** to evaluate understanding

---

### ✅ **6. Set Cultural Expectations**

Use this as a reset opportunity to:

* Build a culture of **code quality and ownership**
* Encourage **peer reviews and open collaboration**
* Set expectations for **accountability and support responsiveness**

---

### ✅ **7. Assign Team Leads for Subsystems**

If your application is modular:

* Assign a developer/tech lead per module (e.g., billing, reports, notifications)
* They become the **go-to person** for knowledge and changes in that area

---

### ✅ **8. Plan for Backup Resources**

To avoid single points of failure:

* Cross-train developers across modules
* Keep a **skill matrix** that tracks who knows what

---

### ✅ Optional: External Help to Jumpstart

If timeline is tight and skills are scarce, consider:

* Hiring a **transition consultant** for 2–3 months
* Using a **code audit service** to fast-track quality review
* Bringing in **freelancers** for non-core work (e.g., testing automation)

Conducting **effective Knowledge Transfer (KT) sessions** is crucial for empowering your in-house team to take full ownership of the application. Here's a practical, structured approach to make your KT sessions efficient, focused, and outcome-driven — especially when your goal is to **improve code quality, delivery timelines, and team responsiveness**.

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Step 5: How to Conduct Knowledge Transfer Sessions

---

### ✅ 1. **Plan KT Sessions as a Series**

Think of KT as a **mini training program** — not a one-time meeting.

* **Create a KT calendar**: Break topics down by technical and functional domains.
* Spread sessions over **2–4 weeks**, depending on application complexity.
* Prioritize **business-critical** and **problem-prone areas** early.

🔧 *Tool Tip*: Use Google Calendar, Outlook, or a shared Notion/Excel doc to track sessions.

---

### ✅ 2. **Define the Format for Each Session**

Each session should include:

| Element          | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Topic**        | Clear subject (e.g., API Layer, Deployment, Auth Logic) |
| **Objective**    | What the in-house team should understand by the end     |
| **Presenter**    | A developer or SME from the vendor side                 |
| **Participants** | Only relevant people (Dev, QA, DevOps, etc.)            |
| **Agenda**       | Structured flow to avoid scope creep                    |
| **Hands-On**     | Live demo or code walkthrough wherever possible         |
| **Q\&A**         | End with open questions                                 |

📝 Always assign a **note taker**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Use a Structured Session Template**

For consistency, structure every session like this:

```
Session Title: "Backend – Order Processing Workflow"
Date: July 3
Duration: 1 hour
Presenter: [Vendor Name]
Attendees: [Dev A, DevOps, QA]

Agenda:
1. Functional Overview
2. Data flow & logic
3. Code walkthrough (Service Layer)
4. Dependencies
5. Common issues
6. Q&A

Action Items:
- Dev A to replicate flow locally
- QA to identify missing test cases
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Record and Document Everything**

* Record all sessions using Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet.
* Store recordings and notes in a central place (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.).
* Summarize takeaways in structured docs or wikis.

📚 *Pro Tip*: Assign team members to **convert each session into documentation** or a playbook.

---

### ✅ 5. **Drive Engagement, Not Just Presentation**

To avoid passive sessions:

* Ask internal devs to **shadow the walkthrough in real time**
* Rotate **reverse demos** where your dev explains what they understood
* Use real-life **support tickets or user flows** during the walkthrough

📣 Encourage your team to:

* Ask **“why”**, not just “what”
* Challenge assumptions
* Take turns replicating tasks on their systems

---

### ✅ 6. **Use a Live System Whenever Possible**

* Walk through real modules and APIs
* Debug small flows live
* Use **screenshare + IDE** for clarity

---

### ✅ 7. **Schedule Q\&A-Only and Follow-Up Sessions**

* Block 1–2 Q\&A sessions weekly
* Encourage internal team to prepare questions
* Vendor should **review understanding gaps** and clarify

---

### ✅ 8. **Assign Takeaways to Reinforce Learning**

| After Session     | Task                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Backend session   | Dev sets up local env and runs a flow |
| CI/CD walkthrough | DevOps replicates build process       |
| API session       | QA tests sample API independently     |
| Database session  | Dev creates ERD or sample queries     |

Use this to validate **knowledge retention**.

---

### ✅ 9. **Use a KT Effectiveness Tracker**

Track who attended, what was covered, and if it was understood.

| Session | Attendee | Follow-up Task      | Completed? | Gaps                   |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| CI/CD   | DevOps A | Replicate pipeline  | ✅          | None                   |
| Auth    | Dev B    | Debug login failure | ❌          | Needs help with config |

---

### ✅ 10. **Close with a Final Review Session**

* Recap each module
* Allow internal team to walk through **critical flows end-to-end**
* Ask them to demonstrate **how they'd handle a bug or release**
* Mark closure once you’re confident in ownership

---

## 🚦Red Flags to Watch For

* Sessions are rushed, no time for Q\&A
* Vendor only “reads slides” without showing the system/code
* Your team doesn’t ask questions or follow up
* KT sessions are too high-level or lack real data examples

---
Performing **code and infrastructure audits** during the transition is essential to uncover technical debt, security risks, scalability limitations, and poor design practices introduced by the third-party vendor. These audits directly support your goals of improving **code quality**, **delivery speed**, and **system reliability**.

---

## 🛠️ Step 6: Do Code & Infrastructure Audits

---

### ✅ 1. **Code Audit – What to Review**

#### 🔍 **a. Code Quality**

* Is the code **readable**, **modular**, and **commented**?
* Are there **naming conventions**, folder structures, and proper formatting?
* Is there **redundant** or **duplicated code**?

#### 📦 **b. Architecture Review**

* Monolithic or modular?
* Are **interfaces**, **design patterns** (e.g., dependency injection, factory) used appropriately?
* Are there clear **separation of concerns** (controller, service, repository layers)?

#### 🧪 **c. Test Coverage**

* Are **unit tests** present? What’s the coverage? (Use tools like JaCoCo, dotCover)
* Are **integration and end-to-end tests** in place?
* Are test cases regularly run in CI?

#### 🔐 **d. Security**

* Are secrets hardcoded?
* Any unvalidated inputs (susceptible to SQL injection/XSS)?
* Usage of outdated or vulnerable libraries?

#### 🐞 **e. Bug-Prone & Legacy Areas**

* Identify modules with frequent production issues or high change churn
* Review large files/functions that violate **single-responsibility principle**
* Check for **dead code** and **TODO comments**

#### 📋 **Tools You Can Use**

* SonarQube / SonarLint
* Resharper (for .NET)
* PMD, Checkstyle, ESLint (JavaScript/Java)
* CodeScene (for behavioral/code health insights)

---

### ✅ 2. **Infrastructure Audit – What to Review**

#### 🌐 **a. Hosting & Cloud Setup**

* Are servers properly sized and configured?
* Are there auto-scaling, load balancing, and backup policies?
* Are resources tagged and named correctly?

#### 🔐 **b. Security & Access**

* Who has access to prod/staging environments?
* Are there **firewall rules, SSL/TLS**, and network segregation?
* Use of **secret managers** (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)?

#### ⚙️ **c. Deployment Process**

* CI/CD pipeline: Is it automated, consistent, and recoverable?
* Rollback process documented and tested?
* Manual steps? Hardcoded environments?

#### 🧩 **d. Monitoring & Alerting**

* Are production services monitored (CPU, memory, error rates)?
* Is there **real-time alerting** (via email, PagerDuty, Slack)?
* Is log aggregation in place (e.g., ELK, Datadog, New Relic)?

#### ♻️ **e. Cost Optimization**

* Are unused resources running?
* Are there cost spikes from misconfigured autoscaling or storage?
* Use tools like **Azure Cost Management**, **AWS Cost Explorer**

---

### ✅ 3. **Prepare an Audit Checklist**

| Area       | Item                         | Priority | Notes                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Code       | No unit tests in core module | High     | Add test coverage           |
| Infra      | Manual deployment to Prod    | Critical | Automate via GitHub Actions |
| Security   | Passwords in config files    | High     | Move to Azure Key Vault     |
| Monitoring | No alerts for DB down        | Medium   | Setup in Grafana            |

---

### ✅ 4. **Who Should Perform the Audits**

* Code Audit: Internal tech leads, or a consultant if needed
* Infra Audit: DevOps engineer or cloud architect
* Optional: Use a **third-party audit firm** for unbiased code review (good ROI in large apps)

---

### ✅ 5. **What to Do After the Audit**

* Classify issues: **Quick fixes**, **Tech debt**, **Refactoring tasks**
* Prioritize with a matrix:

  * 🔴 High Risk / Low Effort → Do Immediately
  * 🟡 Medium Risk / Medium Effort → Backlog
  * 🟢 Low Risk / High Effort → Optional
* Track in your issue tracker (e.g., Jira, Azure Boards)
* Allocate **refactoring sprints** if needed

---

### 🎯 Output You Should Have After This Step

* ✅ Code Quality Report (automated + manual findings)
* ✅ Infra Gap Analysis Report
* ✅ Priority-wise action list (Excel, Jira, or Confluence)
* ✅ Updated backlog of improvement items
* ✅ Baseline test coverage % and goal

---
The **cutover** is the moment where responsibility officially transitions from the vendor to your in-house team. Planning this phase well is crucial — it’s where things either **stabilize** or **fall apart**. A structured and phased approach helps ensure continuity, reduces production risk, and builds confidence within your internal team.

---

## 🚦 Step 7: Plan the Actual Cutover

---

### ✅ 1. **Define Cutover Scope Clearly**

Determine exactly what is being taken over:

* Just **development**, or also **support**, **QA**, **infra**, and **releases**?
* Are you taking over **entire product suite** or specific modules first?
* Does the vendor retain a **backup/fallback role**?

📝 Create a **Cutover Readiness Checklist** (see template at the end).

---

### ✅ 2. **Choose a Cutover Strategy**

Choose one of the following approaches based on complexity and risk:

| Approach           | Description                                                             | Recommended When              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Big Bang**       | One-time full switch to in-house team                                   | Small systems, low complexity |
| **Phased Cutover** | Module-by-module or responsibility-by-responsibility handover           | Medium to large systems       |
| **Shadow Mode**    | Your team handles everything, vendor shadows silently (validation mode) | Final validation stage        |
| **Reverse Shadow** | Vendor handles, your team observes (early phase)                        | First few weeks of KT         |

✔️ Best Practice: Use **Reverse Shadow → Shadow → Phased Cutover** for safer transitions.

---

### ✅ 3. **Create a Cutover Plan**

Break the transition into **phases** with owners and timelines:

#### 📅 Sample Cutover Plan

| Phase                        | Timeline  | Owner            | Notes                                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| KT Completion                | Week 1–4  | Vendor           | All core sessions done                         |
| Shadowing Dev Work           | Week 2–5  | Internal Devs    | Watch how vendor works                         |
| Reverse Shadow (Bug Fixes)   | Week 4–5  | Internal Devs    | Your team fixes with vendor support            |
| Production Release Ownership | Week 6    | Internal Team    | Your team deploys to prod                      |
| Post-Cutover Support         | Week 7–10 | Vendor (standby) | Vendor handles high-severity queries if needed |

---

### ✅ 4. **Validate Cutover Readiness**

Use this checklist to determine readiness:

| Area                                   | Status | Owner           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| KT complete and documented             | ✅      | Tech Lead       |
| CI/CD pipelines reviewed               | ✅      | DevOps          |
| Source control fully accessible        | ✅      | Internal Dev    |
| Secrets/configs in your vaults         | ✅      | DevOps          |
| Your team can run builds independently | ✅      | Dev             |
| Monitoring and alerts verified         | ✅      | Support         |
| Rollback strategy documented           | ✅      | DevOps          |
| Escalation matrix post-cutover         | ✅      | PM/Support Lead |

---

### ✅ 5. **Conduct a Dry Run (Optional but Recommended)**

* Simulate a **real production deploy**, triage a bug, or process a known support issue
* Observe how your team handles it
* Have the vendor watch and provide guidance

🎯 Goal: Catch gaps while you still have vendor support.

---

### ✅ 6. **Plan Communications**

* **Inform stakeholders**: Business, QA, support staff should know about the transition
* **Update escalation matrix**: Who’s on call post-transition?
* Share a **cutover calendar** internally

---

### ✅ 7. **Formalize the Handover**

* Schedule a **Cutover Sign-Off Meeting** with vendor
* Document:

  * What's handed over
  * Remaining issues or TODOs
  * Support agreement (if any)
* Have both sides sign a **handover acceptance note** or email

---

### ✅ 8. **Post-Cutover Stabilization Period (2–4 Weeks)**

* Your team handles all issues
* Vendor remains available for:

  * Critical issues
  * Clarifications
  * Log/file/database help
* Do **weekly retrospectives** to improve

---

### 🎯 Final Output from Cutover Phase

* ✅ Cutover plan with dates, owners, modules
* ✅ Signed-off readiness checklist
* ✅ Communication sent to business/support teams
* ✅ Stable deployments done by your team
* ✅ Vendor exits or moves to standby mode

---
Mitigating risk during the transition from a third-party development team to your in-house team is **absolutely essential** — because even with a solid KT plan, unexpected issues can cause service disruptions, production failures, or knowledge gaps.

Here’s a focused approach for **Step 8: Risk Mitigation**, specifically tailored to your goals: **code quality, delivery speed, and team responsiveness**.

---

## ⚠️ Step 8: Risk Mitigation

---

### ✅ 1. **Identify the Key Risk Areas**

Break the risk landscape into the following categories:

| Category                   | Common Risks                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Knowledge Transfer**     | Incomplete or rushed KT, missing documentation         |
| **Codebase**               | Poor-quality code, no tests, spaghetti architecture    |
| **Infrastructure**         | Deployment misconfigurations, manual pipelines         |
| **Support**                | Inability to resolve production issues promptly        |
| **People**                 | Resignations, limited internal bandwidth or expertise  |
| **Third-party Dependence** | Loss of access to proprietary tools, APIs, or licenses |

---

### ✅ 2. **Create a Risk Register**

Track each risk with severity, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plan.

| Risk                              | Impact   | Probability | Mitigation                               | Owner     |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| KT rushed due to vendor bandwidth | High     | Medium      | Define KT scope, record sessions         | PM        |
| Prod deploy fails post-handover   | High     | Low         | Run dry run, document rollback steps     | DevOps    |
| Code has hidden bugs              | High     | Medium      | Do code audit, write tests               | Tech Lead |
| Internal dev lacks system context | Medium   | High        | Assign reverse shadowing tasks           | Lead Dev  |
| Vendor exits early                | Critical | Low         | Retain vendor for 1–2 months on retainer | PM        |

---

### ✅ 3. **Establish Fallback Options**

* **Vendor Standby Support**: Keep vendor available on-call or hourly for 4–8 weeks post cutover.
* **Documented Escalation Plan**: Who to contact when something breaks.
* **Runbooks for Critical Modules**: Create action guides (e.g., “How to restart the Order Service”).

---

### ✅ 4. **Limit Exposure During Transition**

* Avoid **big releases** during handover.
* Don’t change infrastructure unless necessary.
* Keep **CI/CD and test automation stable** — changes can wait until ownership is firm.

---

### ✅ 5. **Add Internal Buffers**

* Add 10–20% buffer time to timelines for:

  * Extra debugging
  * Late KT sessions
  * Cross-training
* Avoid tight delivery deadlines immediately after cutover.

---

### ✅ 6. **Use Dual Ownership for High-Risk Modules**

Until your team is confident:

* Keep the vendor **involved in review** or as a backup for:

  * Billing logic
  * Login/auth flows
  * Integrations with banks/gateways
* Use **reverse code reviews**: Your team codes, vendor validates.

---

### ✅ 7. **Keep Audit Trails**

If your system handles regulated data (e.g., financial), ensure:

* You log critical operations
* Access controls are reviewed and documented
* Deployment and rollback logs are maintained

---

### ✅ 8. **Monitor Health Post-Cutover**

Set up:

* Alerts for system downtimes
* Log trackers (e.g., Kibana, Splunk)
* Crash/error monitoring (e.g., Sentry, App Insights)

Run a **daily war room (15 min)** for 1–2 weeks post-cutover to resolve issues fast.

---

### ✅ 9. **Schedule Post-Cutover Retrospectives**

After 1–2 weeks:

* What went well?
* What caused delays?
* What knowledge is still missing?

Update your KT or onboarding documents accordingly.

---

## 🧩 Sample Risk Mitigation Plan Document Includes:

* 🔐 Access Risk Mitigation Strategy
* 🧪 Testing Gaps Mitigation Plan
* 🔄 Rollback Process
* 📣 Escalation Matrix
* ⏱️ Time buffer and contingency plan
* 📋 Sign-offs for high-risk modules

---
After the cutover is complete, your work isn’t done — in fact, **post-transition is where the real improvement begins**. This phase is critical to stabilize the system, reinforce learning, and move toward your strategic goals of improving **code quality**, **delivery timelines**, and **team responsiveness**.

---

## ✅ Step 9: Post-Transition Actions

---

### 🔄 1. **Stabilization Period (First 2–4 Weeks)**

* Monitor support tickets closely
* Continue daily/bi-weekly **stand-up or war room meetings**
* Assign someone to triage and prioritize incidents
* Ensure proper logging and error tracking tools are in place (e.g., Sentry, App Insights, ELK)

---

### 🧠 2. **Internal Team Retrospective**

Hold a team retrospective 1–2 weeks post cutover. Discuss:

* What went well in the transition?
* What was unclear or painful?
* Are there still dependencies on vendor knowledge?
* What areas need urgent improvement?

Document this and turn it into backlog items or a stabilization roadmap.

---

### 📊 3. **Measure Baseline Performance Metrics**

To track improvement, capture current performance in key areas:

| Area           | Metric                                                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Quality   | Test coverage %, lint warnings, static code analysis score     |
| Delivery       | Sprint velocity, lead time for changes, story points completed |
| Responsiveness | Avg. bug resolution time, time-to-first-response               |

Create a **dashboard or monthly report** to show progress over time.

---

### 🛠️ 4. **Refactor & Improve**

Use findings from the audit and retrospectives to:

* Clean up messy modules
* Write missing unit tests
* Fix long-standing tech debt
* Modularize monolith components (if relevant)
* Standardize architecture, naming, logging

Prioritize fixes using an **impact-effort matrix**.

---

### 🔧 5. **Refine Processes and Tools**

Improve engineering processes for long-term sustainability:

* Enforce **code reviews**
* Standardize **branching strategy**
* Improve **CI/CD pipeline speed and quality gates**
* Automate test runs on every PR

---

### 📚 6. **Document and Onboard Internally**

* Convert all tribal/vendor knowledge into internal docs
* Finalize SOPs for:

  * Deployments
  * Rollbacks
  * Critical bug fixes
  * Environment setup
* Onboard additional developers or support staff using these documents

---

### 🧑‍💻 7. **Upskill Your Team**

Invest in targeted training:

* Language/framework-specific courses (Java/Spring Boot, .NET, etc.)
* DevOps & CI/CD
* Security best practices
* Testing strategies

Even 1 hour per week per team member on learning will compound into results.

---

### 📥 8. **Decommission Vendor Dependencies (Optional)**

Once stable:

* Remove vendor access to repositories, infra, credentials
* Archive vendor artifacts
* Stop vendor support contract if no longer needed

---

### 📅 9. **Plan for the Future**

Use this clean slate to:

* Expand roadmap: new features, refactoring goals, tech upgrades
* Introduce agile metrics like DORA (Deployment frequency, Lead time, Change failure rate, MTTR)
* Think about long-term architecture modernization (e.g., microservices, cloud-native, etc.)

---

## 📌 Final Outputs from Post-Transition Phase

* ✅ Operationally stable app with in-house support
* ✅ Backlog created from audit and KT feedback
* ✅ Developer onboarding guide + internal wiki
* ✅ Code quality baseline established and improving
* ✅ Vendor access fully revoked or formalized if ongoing

---
